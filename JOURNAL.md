## Project Started on 2.17.2025

To understand what my project is all about, you need to understand the definition of the term "cyberdeck". A cyberdeck is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games
that is used by hackers or "Deckers" to temporarily connect their mind or "jack in" to cyberspace. Some of the first appearances of cyberdecks were in the Sprawl Trilogy by William Gibson in the early 1980s.
In the real world, cyberdecks are "Artisan Crafted Computers," often powered by single-board computers with some sort of display and keyboard made in the cyberpunk aesthetic. This is pulled from the cyberdeck cafe, 
a website that brings a community of "deckers" like me who have a passion for computers, and who also want to learn how to create the perfect "off the grid" device for their personal use.

This is a community I had discovered over 2 years, and I rediscovered this community when I wanted to find the the perfect workstation for me , but also for be used in CTF competitions, AND for learning general cybersecurity, where I can use important tools in the realm of cybersecurity, such as Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, and many other popular cybersecurity tools. 

My ambition for designing and building my cyberdeck is mainly because I'm pretty tired of using a virtual box for my computer, plus, I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could build something with no prior expreience . For the past few months, I have been working towards getting the parts that I need, and as each month has passed, I've bought many big and small components, and have been waiting for the right moment for me to finally get the final parts needed for my cyberdeck. 

This journal doesn't do any justice to showcasing the 4 months of work, research, and planning that I've done, and so here is a doc showing the work that I've done thus far (changes have possibly been done as of committing this journal.)

Day one of the progress so far

June 7th: Day 1 - 4 hours


While this journal is day one of my project, this project has been in the works since February 26th, 2025. I’ve kept this project alive since then, working on it on my free time and watched many videos to understand what I need, from the parts and tools to the design aspect of this project. I want to make this cyberdeck because I absolutely love building computers, and in the past I’ve built my own PC and also created my own home server from an old laptop, and so I wanted to challenge myself by building my own computer (almost) from scratch, where I’d need to figure out the peripherals, the computer that I’d be using, and the design that I’d be using in order to make this cyberdeck a reality for me.

As of creating this journal, I’ve already picked out my parts and modeled my cyberdeck, but I want to spend more time adding more details to the cyberdeck. I want to remodel my cyberdeck since I didn’t like the way that I modeled the housing for all of my peripherals, expansion card, and my battery pack. Having a compact design is the goal of this cyberdeck, along with having my parts in one place. I want to make a name for it, but I haven't found the perfect name for it just yet. So I have decided to use a placeholder name for it, and it is “cyberdeck.” That’s it. A generic name named cyberdeck. I did some modeling on Shapr 3D, and so nothing really eventful happened today.


June 8th: Day 2 - 2 hours

  This is more of an “assess the parts that I have so far” day, since I finally got my keyboard and keycaps for this setup, and I am absolutely in LOVE with the keycaps that I got for my keyboard. I picked the AULA WIN60 HE and went ahead and paired it with some moon project keycaps that I knew would complement the entire setup, and I’m even more excited for when I finally assemble my cyberdeck. Speaking of cyberdecks, I decided to connect my new keyboard to my PC and play Cyberpunk 2077. You might be asking why this is relevant, but it was here that I finally decided to name my cyberdeck “The Blackdeck”, a homage to The Blackwall, a place where dead internet theory is real. This is where deadly AIs are lurking in the shadows of the Internet. It’s my inspiration for creating this cyberdeck and why I was creating it in the first place. While this may not be counted towards the amount of points or hours I’ve spent building this cyberdeck, I still wanted to include it because I’ve finally made up my mind on how I should design this cyberdeck. I want to make it look like a computer that comes from another era, and I want it to follow a strict theme and color combination that makes my cyberdeck look super cool. Therefore, I’ve decided that I want to model my cyberdeck after 2 ingame objects/character, one of which is a terrifying robot called Erebus, and another object that is modeled after a famous hacker/netrunner in the game, the Rache Bartmoss Cyberdeck. Here are the images below:



With these images, I plan on making it to


June 11th: Day 5 - 4.5 hours

  I’ve gone ahead and made some changes to the size of the screen. When I first modeled this cyberdeck, it almost looked like a 3DS, and I wanted to change it in some way, but I couldn’t figure out what I needed to do. But after making some adjustments, I’ve decided that I want the screen to cover the entire keyboard, while the track pad lies out in the open, and it seems like the best approach since it allows more space for where I’m housing my Raspberry Pi. I feel like the cyberdeck looks bland the way it looks like, so I want to make some changes so that it has more depth into the cyberdeck by adding some little details that make my cyberdeck and stand apart from all other cyberdecks. For the display, I plan on using the waveshare 10.4 inch screen, since it has a frame perfect dimensions for the keyboard that I’m using. One more thing I would add is that I learned since getting the keyboard is that while the keyboard is form factor, compact, and has a length of 11 inches, it’s still a pretty long and thick keyboard, so I need to find a way to include the mouse pad. I want it to big and moveable


June 16th: Day 10  - 5 hours

  After looking at further designs, I want to add a handle, a grip for opening my cyberdeck, along with a power button that I can use for my own ease of access. I want it to be helpful for me to carry it around anywhere and so adding these to my design will make my cyberdeck even easier for me to take anywhere that I can. I want to add an additional display alongside my screen so that I can look at the specs and load that each of my components like my cpu and gpu need to undergo. I got this inspirations from the Pironman and NZXT Z73 AIO, where a dedicated screen resides which shows active cooling on both the cpu and gpu, along with ram, and so I want to also implement this into my design.

After pouring so many hours into this CAD model, I have finally finished my Blackdeck and it looks amazing. I love the little vents that I’ve added and also the updated grip so that it’s easier for me to hold, carry on the go, and also open and close my screen. Here is the final photos that I’ve already added a million times:

And after checking the history, I’ve learned that it’s taken me a total of 272 hours to create this cyberdeck, and it’s crazy considering how long I’ve spent adding so many details to this cyberdeck. While I say that I’ve perfected and completed this cyberdeck, I might continue adding a few more details so that it’s frame-perfect.


June 24th: Day 8 - 5 hours

  I’ve decided that I want to make a PCB. Why, you may ask? Well, I want to create a PCB that’s able to solve all of the problems that I have happening throughout my cyberdeck. All of the problems that I want to solve includes organizing the lighting for my cyberdeck, adding the USB-C and USB-A framework expansion card for my cyberdeck since I absolutely do NOT want to have them both loosely connected in such a janky setup, and finally I want to add a custom battery pack so that both my raspberry pi and the rest of my components can continue to running my cyberdeck for long hours while being power efficient, since most other battery pack that I’m looking at don’t match my expectations, so instead I need something that gives me real power. 

Unfortunately, I don’t know how to design a PCB, so I did what any person who wants to learn something new does: I went straight to YouTube. And I learned so much. 

Resistor: Limits the flow of current in a circuit.

Capacitor: A storage system that stores and releases electrical energy, best for AC to DC.

Diode: Electric currents can only go in one direction.

Transistors: They’re switches. What more do you expect?

And there are many more custom PCB components to help build the ultimate PCB for my cyberdeck.

 I’ve also learned about the software that I should use for this process: KiCAD. There are many YouTube tutorials that I looked at, and none of them make sense. But so far, I’ve learned how to add and remove symbols in the browser library, along with adding a footprint to each of my components. This will take time, but I know that I can learn things quickly. The next day that I add to my journal, I hope it’s the completed PCB, but only time will tell..

These are the Youtube links that were the most help for me in order for me to design my PCB:

June 29th: Day 9 - 5 hours

  I’ve learned that making PCBs is incredibly hard. I’ve been working towards creating one that solves the current problems I've with this system, but I haven’t been taking into account the compatibility of each of the components I plan to include. There have been numerous changes made in the addition of this PCB, which also involved a complete overhaul while building this complex system, where I’ve decided that I need a much more powerful, long-lasting, power-efficient battery to power my entire system. I’ve been reliant on a battery pack that connects directly to the Raspberry Pi instead of the system as a whole, so I’ve decided that I want to utilize 18650 cell batteries so that it’s more long-lasting. I’ve learned so far in this journey towards creating my custom PCB that the Framework Expansion cards that I’ve wanted to include in this build don’t work universally with other systems, as they act as “passive adapters” and end up functioning without unlocking their potential, such as Thunderbolt or quick charging, so I need to figure out how to make a framework expansion card work alongside the raspberry pi. 

July 8th Day 17: 4.5 hours

To imitate the framework card’s functions and the way it functions, this is the same framework port similar to the usb-a expansion port, but for USB-C. The framework card I'm using can only be used as a passive controller, and therefore, it cannot have any Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, or HDMI output connections directly to the raspberry pi. That's why I want to mimic it in a way for it to serves these functions, so that I can connect it directly to the Raspberry Pi 5. I can't directly connect it natively and expect it to work, so I want to imitate it in a way that allows it to connect indirectly. With these in mind, below is a list of things that I want the pcb to do: 

-The HDMI can be solved by using an HDMI port to connect directly to a micro HDMI, which can produce a signal for the framework PCB to use as HDMI out. It “fakes” the behavior of which DisplayPort mode functions, but makes it also connect 
-The USB-C connection serves as a way to connect power and charge the battery bank that powers the entire system
-Finally, the the controllers that connects all of these parts will maintain power distribution, letting the controller know where to route its bidirectional power and passive connections all around the pcb.

These are all the methods that I want to implement to make the Raspberry Pi function almost similar to a modern laptop such as a framework laptop. By making these framework expansion parts modular, I’ll be able to reroute my charger and connect peripherals without having go directly inside of my cyberdeck and connect directly into any of my peripherals into my Raspberry Pi that way.

June 27th - The final day - 4.5 hours

I’ve been running around the clock pushing to get this project finalized once and for all. After finally getting my project reviewed and finalized by one of my relatives, they’ve decided that the project is ready for me to submit!  Right now, I’m making any final revisions that I have to in order to finish the project. I’m a little stressed that I’ll miss the deadline since I’ve been working on this project for the past 2 months and now I’m submitting at the last minute. If all of it is goes to waste, I don’t know what I’ll do. While there were a few ups and downs, I still had a lot of fun with the learning process, and the PCB was the last hurdle I needed in order to finally complete this project. I looked at so many tutorials and YouTube videos, and at first, I was confused, but I was able to make it through by asking my close family for some help and guidance throughout the entire process, and I was finally able to make my Dream PCB. 
I enjoyed the journey and the obstacles that I’ve had to face along the way and It’s been really emotional for me, because I had no idea if this project was possible. I’ve come close to quitting so many times because of 

how mentally draining it had been for me, but I’m glad that all of my hard work paid off. Regardless of what happens, I’m glad to finally have this weight lifted off ever since I started this project. I’m able to see the finish line, where I’ll finally able to complete my project. I thank my family, my friends, and the internet strangers that were able to help me. And finally, myself, for enduring the hardships and celebrating every moment for the hurdles that I’ve made it over.
