## Journal

### June 7th - Day 1

While this journal is day one of my project, this project has been in the works since February 26th, 2025. I’ve worked on this project on and off since, working during my free time and learning how to make my cyberdeck better than yesterday, from the parts and tools to the design aspect of this project. I want to make this cyberdeck because I absolutely love building computers, and in the past I’ve built my own PC and also created my own home server from an old laptop, and so I wanted to challenge myself by building my computer from scratch, where I’d need to figure out the peripherals, the computer that I’d be using, and the design that I’d be using to make this cyberdeck a reality for me.

Before creating this journal, I’ve already picked out my parts and modeled my cyberdeck, but I want to spend more time adding more details to the cyberdeck. I want to remodel my cyberdeck since I didn’t like the way that I modeled the housing for all of my peripherals and my battery pack. Having a compact design is the goal of this cyberdeck, along with having my parts in one place. I want to make a name for it, but I haven't found the perfect name for it just yet. So I have decided to use a placeholder name for it, and it is “cyberdeck.” That’s it. A generic name named cyberdeck. However, I hope to change it to a name that’s unique to my build somewhere along the way.

As of today, I did some modeling on Shapr3D, the software that I’m using to create my CAD. While nothing eventful happened while modeling this cyberdeck, I found some inspiration for how I want to tackle the base of the cyberdeck. I wanted to add something unique to the cyberdeck, and that was when I came across a youtuber, Ben Makes Everything, who built a cyberdeck using framework components. But what set apart his design from many other cyberdecks that I had explored was that he didn’t just use framework parts alone, but he also incorporated other components that had been made by other companies. For example, for his peripherals, he used an apple keyboard to reduce the size of his cyberdeck immensely, and when there weren’t any touchpads that were compatible for his cyberdeck, he paired a logtech mouse with an arduino to make his own custom scrollwheel mouse, and that’s what captures the essence of building your own cyberdeck. You always want to build the best system out there, and mixing your parts to make the ultimate cyberdeck was the image that he and I had in mind. Thus, I decided that I wanted to incorporate his design for the framework expansion cards and enhance it so that it can be compatible for my cyberdeck, which was the vision that I had to make this cyberdeck functional.

## Total hours spent: ~ 4 hours

### June 8th: Day 2

  This is more of an “assess the parts that I have so far” day, since I finally got my keyboard and keycaps for this setup, and I am absolutely in LOVE with the keycaps that I got for my keyboard. I picked the AULA WIN60 HE and went ahead and paired it with some moon project keycaps that I knew would complement the entire setup, and I’m even more excited for when I finally assemble my cyberdeck. Speaking of cyberdecks, I decided to connect my new keyboard to my PC and play Cyberpunk 2077. You might be asking why this is relevant, but it was here that I finally decided to name my cyberdeck “The Blackdeck”, a homage to The Blackwall, a place where dead internet theory is real. This is where deadly AIs are lurking in the shadows of the Internet. It’s my inspiration for creating this cyberdeck and why I was creating it in the first place. While this may not be counted towards the amount of points or hours I’ve spent building this cyberdeck, I still wanted to include it because I’ve finally made up my mind on how I should design this cyberdeck. I want to make it look like a computer that comes from another era, and I want it to follow a strict theme and color combination that makes my cyberdeck look super cool. Therefore, I’ve decided that I want to model my cyberdeck after 2 in-game objects/characters, one of which is a terrifying robot called Erebus, and another object that is modeled after a famous hacker/netrunner in the game, the Rache Bartmoss Cyberdeck. Here are the images below:

<img width="1280" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4020e392-5c24-41ea-8011-ed705da14070" />
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Cyberpunk 2077 Screenshot 2025 06 08 - 02 40 58 71" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a979ec9-fa1e-4d79-aaea-46682919e517" />

With these images in mind, I want to make a cyberdeck that combines these two themes, so I’ve decided that I want the cyberdeck to look evil but inviting from its first look, and so I decided to go with an all red aesthetic, and I want to accomplish this look by using a bunch of red neon lights to lighten it up. However, the shell will be separate from the rest of the build because after having done some research, I’ve learned that PETG is best for housing all electronics since it can take heat under maximum load, and it would be helpful especially since I’m permanently adding a raspberry pi to my cyberdeck, which can take in a lot of heat out of all of my components.  

## Total hours spent: ~ 2 hours

### June 11th: Day 5 

  I’ve gone ahead and made some changes to the size of the screen. When I first modeled this cyberdeck, it almost looked like a 3DS, and I wanted to change it in some way, but I couldn’t figure out what I needed to do. But after making some adjustments, I’ve decided that I want the screen to cover the entire keyboard, while the track pad lies out in the open, and it seems like the best approach since it allows more space for where I’m housing my Raspberry Pi. I feel like the cyberdeck looks bland the way it looks, so I want to make some changes so that it has more depth into the cyberdeck by adding some little details that make my cyberdeck stand apart from all other cyberdecks. 

For the display, I plan on using the waveshare 10.4 inch screen, since it has a frame perfect for the keyboard that I’m using. One more thing I would add is that I learned since getting the keyboard. While the keyboard is form factor, compact, and has a length of 11 inches, it’s still a pretty long and thick keyboard, so I need to find a way to include a trackpad in my setup, and I don’t wanna sacrifice any space. The ideal trackpad that I have in mind is compact, but also able to be used comfortably without making my hand uncomfortable. I plan to use this cyberdeck for a couple of hours, so I want my experience of using this to be as comfortable as possible.

## Total hours spent: ~ 4.5 hours

### June 16th: Day 10 

  After looking at further designs, I’ve decided that I want to add a handle, a grip for opening my cyberdeck, along with a power button that I can use for my ease of access. I want it to be helpful for me to carry it around anywhere, and so adding these to my design will make my cyberdeck even easier for me to take anywhere that I can. I want to add a display alongside my screen so that I can look at the specs and load that each of my components like my cpu and gpu need to undergo. I got this inspiration from the Pironman and NZXT Z73 AIO, where a dedicated screen resides which shows active cooling on both the cpu and gpu, along with ram, and so I want to also implement this into my design. Here is some more inspiration:

And after pouring so many hours into this CAD model, I have finally finished my Blackdeck, and it looks amazing. I love the little vents that I’ve added and also the updated grip so that it’s easier for me to hold, carry on the go, and also open and close my screen. Here are the final photos that I’ve already added a million times:

And after checking the history, I’ve learned that it’s taken me a total of 272 hours to create this cyberdeck, and it’s crazy considering how long I’ve spent adding so many details to this cyberdeck. While I say that I’ve perfected and completed this cyberdeck, I might continue adding a few more details so that it’s frame-perfect. But till further notice, I declare that as of writing this entry, I’ve completed my cyberdeck frame. I’m planning on finalizing and submitting this project by a deadline (June 20th, 2025)

Here are the final captures of the CAD that I've created as of now:

## Total hours spent: ~ 5 hours

### June 24th: Day 18 

I went ahead and submitted in on Sunday, but then I realized that I had done the steps towards submitting my Project all wrong. This may seem sudden after immediately getting rejected, but I’ve decided that I want to create a PCB. Why, you may ask? Well, I want to create a PCB because after further analyzing my cyberdeck, I realized that there wasn’t any way for me to power on my cyberdeck, and I can’t directly connect my framework expansion cards to my Raspberry Pi. All of the problems that I want to solve includes organizing the lighting for my cyberdeck, adding the USB-C and USB-A framework expansion card for my cyberdeck since I do NOT want to have them both loosely connected in such a janky setup, and finally I want to add a custom battery pack so that both my raspberry pi and the rest of my components can continue to running my cyberdeck for long hours while being power efficient, since most other battery pack that I’m looking at don’t match my expectations, so instead I need something that gives me real power. 

Unfortunately, I don’t know how to design a PCB, so I did what any person who wants to learn something new does: I went straight to YouTube. And I learned so much.

Transistors: They’re switches. What more do you expect?

While I've only learned about the power symbols, I'll learn how to understand the symbols themselves when I start to identify what I want to add to my PCB.  

I’ve also learned about the software that I should use for this process: KiCAD. There are many YouTube tutorials that I looked at, and none of them make sense. But so far, I’ve learned how to add and remove symbols in the browser library, along with adding a footprint to each of my components. This will take time, but I know that I can learn things quickly. The next day that I add to my journal, I hope it’s the completed PCB, but only time will tell..

These are the YouTube links that were the most helpful for me to learn:

### June 29th: Day 23 

  I’ve learned that making PCBs is incredibly hard. I’ve been working towards creating one that solves the current problems I've with this system, but I haven’t been taking into account the compatibility of each of the components I plan to include. There have been numerous changes made in the addition of this PCB, which also involved a complete overhaul while building this complex system, where I’ve decided that I need a much more powerful, long-lasting, power-efficient battery to power my entire system. I’ve been reliant on a battery pack that connects directly to the Raspberry Pi instead of the system as a whole, so I’ve decided that I want to utilize 18650 cell batteries so that it’s more long-lasting. I’ve learned so far in this journey towards creating my custom PCB that the Framework Expansion cards that I’ve wanted to include in this build don’t work universally with other systems, as they act as “passive adapters” and end up functioning without unlocking their potential, such as Thunderbolt or quick charging, so I need to figure out how to make a framework expansion card work alongside the raspberry pi. 

## Total hours spent: ~ 5 hours

### July 8th: Day 33

I’ve decided to start from scratch again, since I wasn't going in any direction in particular, so I decided instead that I would learn to 

To imitate the framework card’s functions and the way it functions, this is the same framework port, similar to the USB-A expansion port, but for USB-C. The framework card I'm using can only be used as a passive controller, and therefore, it cannot have any Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, or HDMI output connections directly to the raspberry pi. That's why I want to mimic it in a way to serve these functions, so that I can connect it directly to the Raspberry Pi 5. I can't directly connect it natively and expect it to work, so I want to imitate it in a way that allows it to connect indirectly. With these in mind, below is a list of things that I want the PCB to do: 

-The HDMI can be solved by using an HDMI port to connect directly to a micro HDMI, which can produce a signal for the framework PCB to use as HDMI out. It “fakes” the behavior of which DisplayPort mode functions, but also makes it connect 

-The USB-C connection serves as a way to connect power and charge the battery bank that powers the entire system

-Finally, the controllers that connect all of these parts will maintain power distribution, letting the controller know where to route its bidirectional power and passive connections all around the PCB.

These are all the methods that I want to implement to make the Raspberry Pi function almost similar to a modern laptop, such as a framework laptop. By making these framework expansion parts modular, I’ll be able to reroute my charger and connect peripherals without having to go directly inside of my cyberdeck and connect directly into any of my peripherals into my Raspberry Pi that way. While this is great progress towards understanding what I need for my PCB, it will take another week until I officially pick out the parts, since I will be taking a break from this project and will be gone for a project, so I will start working the first chance I get back home.

### July 15th: Day 17

It is July 15th. After finding the right parts, I needed to stay organized and composed, and I also felt like I vaguely explained what I wanted for my PCB. So for this Journal Entry, I decided to go in depth, and so what better way than writing all of my thoughts out in this Journal? (How Convenient!) 

### The Custom PCB for Raspberry Pi 5

This custom PCB is designed to mimic that of a Framework laptop (or the bridge to it) and bring its unique capabilities into a Raspberry Pi 5 with the goal of using the expansion cards to its full extent. In itself, the expansion card is simply a passive controller when it’s not paired with what it’s designed for. This means by connecting it into a Raspberry Pi instead of a Framework computer, it doesn’t get used to its full extent, so this means there’s no thunderbolt, DisplayPort, or USB support. However, this PCB aims to solve this by using a couple of neat tricks and gimmicks to “fake” these signals so that you can make it function as if it were to have Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, AND USB support.

The PCB performs three simple tasks in order to make this possible:

HDMI Video Output:
In place of using native USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode (which the Raspberry Pi 5 doesn't support), the board takes a simple HDMI signal from the micro-HDMI port on the Pi and routes it to a HDMI Type A connector. From there, it gets routed to one of the requisite USB-C ports which allows the system to have an HDMI out. You might be saying that it’s dangerous for the system, which is why I’m using a Texas Instruments HD3SS215IRTQR, which is able to help me by routing its power so my PCB doesn’t get fried when it gets connected to a display. And so, by simply hooking up a USB-C to HDMI male connector, it should theoretically be able to perform the functions of DisplayPort as intended. 

Charging Capabilities
A USB-C port paired with a CH244K is a simple means to charge my system. Power provided by it charges a lithium battery bank distributes its power by using a Buck Converter MP1584EN. I'll be able to route its power so that it can output its 65W to both the PCB and also the Raspberry Pi itself.

Central Control and Power Routing:
Power controllers and routing logic are embedded within the control power and signal distribution on the board. They determine whether power is being delivered to or from the battery, power routing between devices, and correct passive signal routing between USB, HDMI, and power lines. This enacts an orchestrated, bidirectional system simulating operation of a fully functional USB-C Framework Expansion Card.

I'd been struggling with how I should tackle the PCB, so by using their suggestions, I was able to create a detailed mockup for what I wanted my PCB to do. And by doing this, I was finally able to recieve the outside help that I needed. I reached out to reddit, my friends, and a couple of other people before I landed on a master, who guided me towards getting the right parts. below is a list of thing that I've finally been able to get together, from the help of my uncle.

## Here are all the parts that I’ll be using for this PCB:
Conn_02x20_Top_Bottom
- CH224K (For USB-C Connector)
- 12401610E4_2A (USB-C Receptacle)

Over the next couple of days, I will be working on this PCB and getting all of these parts wired correctly. Hopefully, I’ll be able fully finish this PCB before the deadline. 

**For future reference, I wasn’t able to record any of my progress when I was actually making my PCB, so forgive me for not recording any progress that I had made. This day skips from the 15th to the 27th, where I’m finally able to establish this project.

### June 27th - The Final Day

I’ve been running around the clock pushing to get this project finalized once and for all. After finally getting my project reviewed and finalized by one of my relatives, they’ve decided that the project is ready for me to submit!  Right now, I’m making any final revisions that I have to make in order to finish the project. I’m a little stressed that I’ll miss the deadline since I’ve been working on this project for the past 2 months, and now I’m submitting at the last minute. If all of it goes to waste, I don’t know what I’ll do. While there were a few ups and downs, I still had a lot of fun with the learning process, and the PCB was the last hurdle I needed in order to finally complete this project finally. I looked at so many tutorials and YouTube videos, and at first, I was confused, but I was able to make it through by asking my close family for some help and guidance throughout the entire process, and I was finally able to make the PCB that I had intended to. 

I enjoyed the journey and the obstacles that I’ve had to face along the way, and it’s been emotional for me, because I had no idea if this project was possible. I’ve come close to quitting so many times because of how mentally draining it has been for me, but I’m glad that all of my hard work paid off. Regardless of what happens, I’m glad to finally have this weight lifted off ever since I started this project. I’m able to see the finish line, where I’ll finally be able to complete my project. I thank my family, my friends, and the internet strangers who were able to help me. And finally, Me, for enduring the hardships and celebrating every moment for the hurdles that I’ve overcome.
