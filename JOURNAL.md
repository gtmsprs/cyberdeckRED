## Project Started on 2.17.2025

To understand what my project is all about, you need to understand the definition of the term "cyberdeck". A cyberdeck is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games
that is used by hackers or "Deckers" to temporarily connect their mind or "jack in" to cyberspace. Some of the first appearances of cyberdecks were in the Sprawl Trilogy by William Gibson in the early 1980s.
In the real world, cyberdecks are "Artisan Crafted Computers," often powered by single-board computers with some sort of display and keyboard made in the cyberpunk aesthetic. This is pulled from the cyberdeck cafe, 
a website that brings a community of "deckers" like me who have a passion for computers, and who also want to learn how to create the perfect "off the grid" device for their personal use.

This is a community I had discovered over 2 years, and I rediscovered this community when I wanted to find the the perfect workstation for me , but also for be used in CTF competitions, AND for learning general cybersecurity, where I can use important tools in the realm of cybersecurity, such as Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, and many other popular cybersecurity tools. 

My ambition for designing and building my cyberdeck is mainly because I'm pretty tired of using a virtual box for my computer, plus, I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could build something with no prior expreience . For the past few months, I have been working towards getting the parts that I need, and as each month has passed, I've bought many big and small components, and have been waiting for the right moment for me to finally get the final parts needed for my cyberdeck. 

This journal doesn't do any justice to showcasing the 4 months of work, research, and planning that I've done, and so here is a doc showing the work that I've done thus far (changes have possibly been done as of committing this journal.)

|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| SBC                              | Raspberry Pi 5             | -$89.00     |
| Fan                              | Argon Thermal Cooler       | -$11.99     |
| Screen                           | Waveshare 10.4inch screen  | -115.99     |
| LED module(s)                    | 9x16 LED Matrix, nOOds LED | ~20.95      |
| Power Button                     | ChromaTek Full-Color RGB   | -14.95      |
| Storage                          | Pinmori NVMe, WD Blue 500GB| ~64.94      |
| Keyboard                         | Aula WIN60 HE              | -39.99      |
| Trackpad                         | MCSaite Wired USB Touchpad | -29.99      |
| Framework Expansion Card(s)      | USB-A and -C Expansion Card| ~$22        |
| Battery Pack                     | MakerFocus Battery Pack    | -$35.99     |
| 3D printed Cyberdeck Case        | PCBway                     | ~$30        |
| PCB Fabrication                  | PCBway                     | ~$20        |
| Total cost                       |                            | 495.79      |

This is the final cost of the entire build, but note that I've already bought most of the parts, and so if we exclude
The cost of the SBC, Fan, and Keyboard, you get a total cost of 344.81.
