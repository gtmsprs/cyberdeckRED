To understand what my project is all about, you must understand the definition of the term "cyberdeck". A cyberdeck is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games
that is used by hackers or "Deckers" to temporarily connect their mind or "jack in" to cyberspace. Some of the first appearances of cyberdecks were in the Sprawl Trilogy by William Gibson in the early 1980s.
In the real world, cyberdecks are "Artisan Crafted Computers," often powered by single-board computers with some sort of display and keyboard made in the cyberpunk aesthetic. This is pulled from the cyberdeck cafe, 
a website that brings a community of "deckers" like me who have a passion for computers, and who also want to learn how to create the perfect "off the grid" device for their personal use.

I've always had a perfect workstation for me to use not just casually, but also to be used in CTF competitions, AND for learning general cybersecurity, where I can use important tools in the realm of cybersecurity, such 
as Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, and many other popular cybersecurity tools. I want to create such a project since I've always had a fascination for portable computers, and also because I'm pretty tired of
using a virtual box. For the past few months, I have been working towards building a cyberdeck. I haven't had the proper funds to buy all of my materials, but as each month has passed, I've bought many big and small 
components, and have been waiting for the right moment for me to finally get the final parts needed for my cyberdeck. This journal doesn't do any justice to what I've worked on so far, so instead, it's highly recommended 
that you find the Read Me section and look at the progress I've made.
