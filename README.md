#The Blackdeck - a Cyberpunk 2077-inspired build

## Project Started on 2.17.2025

To understand what my project is all about, you need to understand the definition of the term "cyberdeck". A cyberdeck is a personal mobile computer found in many cyberpunk novels and video games
that is used by hackers or "Deckers" to temporarily connect their mind or "jack in" to cyberspace. Some of the first appearances of cyberdecks were in the Sprawl Trilogy by William Gibson in the early 1980s.
In the real world, cyberdecks are "Artisan Crafted Computers," often powered by single-board computers with some sort of display and keyboard made in the cyberpunk aesthetic. This is pulled from the cyberdeck cafe, 
a website that brings a community of "deckers" like me who have a passion for computers, and who also want to learn how to create the perfect "off the grid" device for their personal use.

This is a community I discovered over two years ago, and I recently rediscovered it while searching for the perfect workstation - not just for general purpose, but also for use in CTF competitions and for learning cybersecurity. I wanted a setup that could support essential cybersecurity tools like Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, and many other widely used programs in the field.

My ambition for designing and building my cyberdeck mainly comes from being tired of relying on a virtual machine for my computer. On top of that, I wanted to challenge myself and see if I could build something from scratch with no prior experience. Over the past few months, I’ve been steadily working toward gathering all the parts I need. With each passing month, I’ve collected both major and minor components—and now, I’ve been waiting for the right moment to finally secure the last pieces needed to complete my cyberdeck. And that's when I came across Highway to the Undercity!

After having done submitted my journal, I felt that I hadn't  doesn't do any justice to showcasing the 6 months of work, research, and planning that I've done, and so here is a doc showing the raw work that I've done to this date (changes have possibly been done as of committing this journal.)
